# Crop Recommendation in Agriculture

## Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates a machine learning approach to recommend the most suitable crops for specific soil and environmental conditions. The goal is to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in making informed decisions to enhance crop yield and sustainability.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that recommends the best crop to plant based on factors such as soil composition (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), environmental conditions (Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall), and historical crop data.

## Methodology
- **Data Analysis**: I began by exploring the dataset to understand its structure, detect any missing values, and visualize the relationships between different features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: I preprocessed the data by scaling numerical features, encoding categorical variables (such as crop names), and handling any missing data to make it suitable for machine learning models.
- **Model Selection**: I experimented with various machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective model for crop recommendation. This involved testing different classification models and tuning their hyperparameters to optimize performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: I evaluated the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine which model provided the best crop recommendations.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in optimizing crop selection by providing data-driven recommendations based on specific field conditions. Future work could involve expanding the model to include additional datasets or refining the algorithm to improve prediction accuracy.
